# Project Notes — Brutal Zombie Horde Survival (BZHS)

---

## Development Workflow (Permanent)

**Primary coding environment:** Replit Agent
**Testing environment:** Antigravity (local PC)

| Environment | Role | Push Frequency |
|-------------|------|---------------|
| **Replit** | Main coding, building, pushing to GitHub | Most pushes |
| **Antigravity** | Pull, test mod in-game on local PC, occasional code + push | Less frequent |

**Sync Rules:**
1. **Before coding in Antigravity:** Always `git pull` first to grab latest from Replit.
2. **Before starting work in Replit after an Antigravity session:** Run `git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/master` to pick up anything pushed from Antigravity.
3. **Never squash or rebase from Replit** — Replit cannot force-push to GitHub. Do history cleanup from Antigravity only.
4. **Replit auto-creates checkpoint commits** ("Transitioned from Plan to Build mode", task completion commits). This is normal. Squash from Antigravity if cleaner history is desired, then sync Replit with step 2.
5. **Replit creates `subrepl-*` branches** for parallel task agents. These are temporary and can be deleted from Antigravity after tasks are merged.

## Current Status & Next Up

**Completed Milestones:** 1 (Scaffold), 2 (Player Stats), 3 (Debuffs — all 12 types), 4 (Temperature — partial), 5 (Heatmap), 6 (Loot & Crafting), 7 (XP/Leveling/Perks), 8 (Blood Moon/Horde Night), 9 (HUD — compass, minimap, stats overlay).

**March 16–17 Major Completed Work:**
- Zombie AI behavior tree refactored (#72) — fully layered, priority-ordered, conditions-checked AI system
- Gameplay bugfixes (#76) — assorted client/server crashes and balance corrections
- Textures, models, and blockstates added and organized (#77)
- New world startup fixes — mod now correctly initializes a fresh world without errors (#78)
- Zombie block breaking AI fix (#79) — path-to-target correctly triggers block break behavior
- Minimap fix (#80) — terrain rendering and player tracking corrected
- HP display fix (#81) — health readout now accurate at all HP values
- Health and combat rebalance (#82, #83) — zombie HP/damage tuned, player survivability improved
- Item texture fixes (#84) — missing/broken item textures resolved
- Container GUI fixes (#85) — workstation and loot container GUIs stable
- Language file updates (#89) — all new items, blocks, and UI strings localized
- Deprecated API fixes (#91) — NeoForge API call sites updated to current 1.21.4 signatures
- Legacy config cleanup (#92) — stale config keys removed, config files reorganized
- Zombie AI special abilities (#93) — block breaking, heatmap investigation trigger, horde pathfinding, variant-specific abilities (acid spit, charge, ground pound, etc.)
- Workstation recipe processing (#94) — all 7 workstations now process recipes with correct fuel logic and output
- Basic weapons system (#95) — melee and ranged weapons implemented with damage, range, and attack speed
- Placeholder texture audit (#97) — full audit run; 349 of 388 textures flagged as placeholder (report at `docs/texture_audit.md`)
- Sound system foundation (#98) — 8 custom sound events, gated playback, subtitles
- Icon-based HUD (#100) — stat bars replaced with icon rows (hearts, food, water, armor icons)
- Texture processing tool (#101) — batch tool for generating and validating texture assets
- Territory POI system (#102) — star-rated points of interest with procedural structures
- 3D weapon animations (#103) via GeckoLib — AK-47, 9mm Pistol, Grenade with full animations
- Funding page (#104) — Behind the Build support page added to landing site
- GeckoLib Jar-in-Jar (#105) — single-file mod distribution, no external dependency needed
- Sprint Mixin fix (#106) — client-side `LocalPlayer.aiStep()` Mixin prevents rubber-banding
- Context-aware gameplay music (#107) — day/night/combat/blood moon tracks with crossfading
- Magazine / Skill Book system (#108–#109) — 6 series (Steady Steve, Block Brawler, Sharpshot Sam, The Tinkerer, Overworld Chef, Dungeon Tactician), 36 items, per-issue bonuses, series mastery tracking, Minecraft-ified names
- Custom biome system (#110) — 7 biomes (Pine Forest, Forest, Plains, Desert, Snowy Tundra, Burned Forest, Wasteland) with per-biome temperature ranges, zombie density multipliers, loot tier bonuses; integrated into PlayerStatsHandler, LootStageCalculator, TerritoryZombieSpawner
- Trademark name sweep (#111) — Duke's Casino Token → Survivor's Coin; 8 zombie display names renamed (Feral Wight→Feral Wraith, Frozen Lumberjack→Frostbitten Woodsman, Cop→Riot Husk, Screamer→Banshee, Demolisher→Wrecking Husk, Mutated Chuck→Mutated Brute, Spider Zombie→Wall Creeper, Bloated Walker→Bloated Shambler); 12 perk IDs+names renamed

**Current Focus / In Progress:**
- Overworld biome placement — surface builder / noise router for custom biome definitions (definitions exist, placement pending)

**Next Up:**
- Custom textures — replace 349 placeholder textures with real pixel art (prioritize HUD icons, weapons, workstations)
- Full world generation pipeline (city grid, POI templates)
- Trader NPCs and quest system
- Vehicle system

## Known Bugs / Polish To Address

1. **SPRINT BUG — FIXED** (Task #106):
   - Sprint rubber-banding resolved via client-side `LocalPlayerSprintMixin` on `LocalPlayer.aiStep()`.
   - Registered under `"client"` key in `sevendaystominecraft.mixins.json`.

2. **F3 DEBUG SCREEN DAY COUNTER** (likely resolved):
   - After the slower-tick refactor (#60), `dayTime` stays on a vanilla 24k scale. F3 day counter should now match the HUD. Verify during next test session.

3. **PLACEHOLDER TEXTURES (349 of 388)** — Most item, GUI, and some block textures are auto-generated colored squares. Gameplay is functional but visually unpolished. Full list in `docs/texture_audit.md`.

## Next Session — Debug & Test Checklist (March 17+)

- **P1 — Build & Launch:** Does the mod build cleanly? Any Mixin or registry errors on startup?
- **P2 — Basic Weapons (melee):** Stone Axe, Wooden Club, Baseball Bat, Sledgehammer — do they deal correct damage with quality scaling? Attack speed correct?
- **P3 — Basic Weapons (ranged):** Pipe Pistol, Primitive Bow — do they fire? Ammo consumption correct? Hit detection working?
- **P4 — Workstation Recipe Processing:** Campfire, Forge, Workbench — do recipes process with correct fuel consumption and output? Does Forge smelting take the right time?
- **P5 — Zombie AI Special Abilities:** Cop acid spit, Demolisher ground pound, Spider climbing, Charged chain lightning — do variant abilities trigger correctly? Does block breaking AI activate on targeted blocks?
- **P6 — Icon-Based HUD:** Hearts, food, water, armor shown as icon rows (not stat bars)? Icons update correctly as values change? No overlap with compass or minimap?
- **P7 — Heatmap + Zombie Investigation:** Does horde pathfinding respond to heat? Do zombies investigate high-heat areas?
- **P8 — Container GUIs:** Open all workstation and loot container GUIs — do they render correctly and accept/process items?
- **P9 — World Startup:** Does a fresh new world generate and load without errors or crashes?
- **P10 — Blood Moon:** Every 7th night still triggers correctly with the rebalanced zombie HP/damage?
- **P11 — Territory POIs (once merged):** Do POI structures spawn in expected locations and biomes?
- **P12 — Sound System (once merged):** Do zombie sounds, combat sounds, and ambient sounds play correctly? Any missing sound events?
- **P13 — Geckolib Animations (once merged):** Do animated weapon and zombie models render without errors?
- **P14 — Sprint Bug (deferred):** Sprint still broken? (Expected — not fixed yet.)
- **P15 — Landing Page + Funding:** Funding page loads? Ko-fi/Patreon links work?
